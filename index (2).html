  <div class="word">Plastic breaks down into tiny pieces of plastics that scientists call microplastics.
  When a plastic piece is smaller than 5 mm it is considered a microplastic. 
  Microplastics are found everywhere including the water we drink and the food we eat, especially fish. 
  Due to the bright colors on plastic, it ends up being confused as food by fish in the ocean. 
  An Ecologist at the University of Toronto specializes on microplastics and how they make their way into the food chain. 
  This ecologist has found microplastic in insect! What is not to say that they are inside of us.</div>
