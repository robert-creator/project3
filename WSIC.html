 <div class="summary">Marine pollution is disrupting the ecosystem. 
 Trash is unnatural and cannot decay. Whatever we throw out there will stay there for decades. 
 That trash is not just littered it goes through a cycle. 
 It sometimes makes it into our food when we eat fish. 
 Whatever we put out there comes back to us litterers. 
 We have to be responsible and take charge of our own trash.</div>
