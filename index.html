<div class="EE"><h2>The graph displayed on the left  shows all of the output of trash that other countries contribute to. 
 All of this trash ends up in trash islands known as  great garbage patches.
 There are five of this in this world. The biggest one being the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. 
 The trash is picked up by the ocean currents to these great patches of trash. 
 Which are toxic for any creature, including us humans. Water and heat causes the plastic to emit poisonous toxins which ends up killing birds and sea life around the patch.
 They are basically death traps in the ocean. The environmental effects that trash has towards the ocean are immeasurable. And it should be our priority to undo the knots created over time. 
 It is time to take out the trash.<h2></div>

 <div class="EE"><h2>We can decrease the amount of trash that ends up in this garbge patches. You can dispose plastics in the recycling bin. 
 And if possible, clean disposable single-use plastics to make it possible for recycling. 
 Plastic is very dangerous and should be kept away from sea-life and wild-life.<h2></div>
